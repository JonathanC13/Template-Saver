<h2>Introduction</h2>
During ones journey playing the MMO Lost Ark Online, they may find themselves, possibly with 
no volition of their own, having a multitude of characters that have to perform activities related 
to combat and therefore may not always instantly recall what each skill’s effects are. Having a 
simple application that is configurable to display each hot key’s combat ability’s effects may be 
beneficial to a user that needs a quick review of the character’s current layout or can glance at 
it when they need an ability with a specific effect.
  
The implemented solution uses:
<ol>

<h2>Exec</h2>
