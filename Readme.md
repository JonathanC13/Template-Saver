<h2>Introduction</h2>
During one's journey playing the MMO Lost Ark Online, they may find themselves, possibly with 
no volition of their own, having a multitude of characters that have to perform activities related 
to combat and therefore may not always instantly recall what each skill’s effects are. Having a 
simple application that is configurable to display each hot key’s combat ability’s effects may be 
beneficial to a user that needs a quick review of the character’s current layout or can glance at 
it when they need an ability with a specific effect.

This game/job is desgined to be a time sink for players' feeble attempt to stay on the bleeding edge; I've obviously failed to stay up to date with ability and content. The only reason I keep engaging with inherently toxic activities is because of the life time crisis of "purpose."
